# Tophat Next Gen

TophatNG is an alternative Tophat for the Voron v0.1 which uses the BOM panels. It provides ~30mm in additional height as well as better access via the additional door. It also comes with hinges that can be used with the [] Tophat hinge mod.

## Printing:

- Use the Voron defaults and print in ABS. I have successfully printed the main body part(s) using 0.5mm layer width and 0.25mm layer height with 25% infill. This reduces both the time to print and the amount of filament used
- The parts are orientated correctly in the STLs

There is the choice of printing the whole body using the TophatNG_Unibody if you have a printer with a print bed of at least 238x238mm. Otherwise, you can print the seperate quarters on a printer with at least 119x119mm printer bed. So they can be printed on a Voron v0!
