# RoundHouse Direct Extruder

The RoundHouse is a direct drive extruder designed for the Voron v0.1

It uses the mounts from the [Mini-AfterSherpa](https://github.com/KurioHonoo/Mini-AfterSherpa) and was designed to complement the [5015 Toolhead](https://github.com/waytotheweb/voron/tree/main/V0/5015_Toolhead) toolhead. It can be used on any toolhead that uses the [Mini-AfterSherpa](https://github.com/KurioHonoo/Mini-AfterSherpa) design.
